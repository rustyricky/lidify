## Music Discovery

**Discover Weekly** - AI-generated weekly playlists based on your listening history. Customize parameters like track duration and date ranges to fine-tune your discoveries.

**Smart Mixes** - Automatically generated playlists including era-based mixes (90s, 2000s), genre mixes, top tracks, rediscover mix (songs you haven't played in a while), and artist similarity mixes.

**Library Radio Stations** - One-click radio modes including Shuffle All, Workout (high energy), Discovery (lesser-played gems), and Favorites (most played). Genre and decade-based radio stations are dynamically created from your library.

**Similar Artists & Recommendations** - Powered by Last.fm integration, discover artists similar to ones you love and get personalized recommendations based on your listening habits.

## The Vibe System

**Vibe Button** - The standout feature. While listening to any track, tap the vibe button to see real-time audio analysis including energy, mood (valence), danceability, tempo, and arousal levels displayed on a visual radar chart.

**Keep The Vibe Going** - Uses ML mood predictions (Happy, Sad, Relaxed, Aggressive, Party, Acoustic, Electronic) to queue tracks that match your current vibe with a match percentage score.

**Mood Mixer** - Create custom playlists by adjusting mood sliders or using presets like Happy, Energetic, Chill, Focus, or Workout. The system finds tracks in your library matching your desired vibe.

## Playlist Import

**Spotify Import** - Paste any Spotify playlist URL to import. Preview shows which tracks match your library, which albums need downloading, and which tracks have no matches. Selectively download what you need.

**Deezer Import** - Same functionality for Deezer playlists. Browse Deezer's featured and genre playlists directly in-app.
